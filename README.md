## Project Motivation/Objective 
The Bridge program is a summer program which aims to help students who have been placed into remedial math courses test into credit bearing math courses by way of a placement exam. The objecitive is to gain insight on which students succeed in the program and which students may benefit from taking the remedial courses. 

### Methods used 
* Logistic regression 

### Technologies 
* R
* ggplot (visualization)

## Project Description
Prior to entering the Bridge program, students take a palcement test which tells them which math course they are eligible to enroll. Students who place in remedial classes are encouraged to participate in the Bridge program.
The student needs a score of 46 or greater to be placed into a credit bearing math class and this is considered a success. Since the outcome is binary I selected a binary regression model (specifically logistic regression). The only information we can use to recommend the program to students is their first placement exam score so I use this as the only feature (regresssor).
There are 208 available observations (i.e. n=208).
